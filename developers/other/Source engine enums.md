    never_as_string = bit.lshift(1, 12), -- never try to print that cvar
    replicated = bit.lshift(1, 13), -- server setting enforced on clients, TODO rename to FCAR_SERVER at some time
    cheat = bit.lshift(1, 14), -- Only useable in singleplayer / debug / multiplayer & sv_cheats

    reload_materials = bit.lshift(1, 20), -- If this cvar changes, it forces a material reload
    reload_textures = bit.lshift(1, 21), -- If this cvar changes, if forces a texture reload
    not_connected = bit.lshift(1, 22), -- cvar cannot be changed by a client that is connected to a server
    material_system_thread = bit.lshift(1, 23), -- Indicates this cvar is read from the material system thread
